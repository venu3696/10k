            <img id="niagara" src="https://www.cliftonhill.com/sites/default/files/whirlpoolchristine6.jpg" width="100%" alt="niagara">
            <p>Niagara falls is that popular because of many reasons. Firstly, the name of city or town is also Niagara falls and there is one more city with same name on america side. Niagara falls is shared attraction
                 between america and canada. It is very beautiful place.. Then there are boats run by both countries which take you nearly under waterfall.
                  There is a bridge near to the waterfall that connects both countries. Then, every friday evening there is beautiful fireworks. Apart from this, the laser lights add various colors to the water flowing
                   down which add to the beauty of waterfalls at night time. Last but not the least there are many more attractions around the falls as well as in the city like Queen Elizabeth park, water parks etc.</p></div>

                <p>Mount Everest is one of the most popular destinations in Tibet. Each year, thousands of tourists come to take this once in a lifetime trip from all around the world. Don't take it granted that Mount
                     Everest is the highest mountain in the world and nothing else special. Mount Everest will surprise you with its extraordinary landscape and brilliant influence in the world.
                    Besides the stunning landscape of Mount Everest itself, there are two great highlights on the Mount Everest - Rongbuk Monastery and Everest Base Camp. Rongbuk Monastery is a Buddhist temple which is
                     believed to be the highest temple in the world. While the Everest Base Camp is the biggest base camp for mountaineers who want to conquer the highest peak in the world.</p>

                <h2>Varanasi...</h2>
                <img id="varanasi" src="https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/varanasi-picture-id537988165?k=20&m=537988165&s=612x612&w=0&h=xdeP5tSUu01idPxvkb1my12DxL2B9oSIu6uWAdi7V7U="  width="100%" alt="varanasi">
                <p> Varanasi is one of the oldest cities in the world, which makes it rich with cultural heritage. The city is home to ghats, temples, museums, and many Puranic places.
                    The best time to visit Varanasi is during the winter months (November to February). Although it gets fairly cold during the winters, this is the best time when you can explore the holy city without 
                    getting tired. The average low temperature is around 5Â°C.  Varanasi to stay for, I'd say 2 nights and 2 days is enough.  Re: 2N/3D tour plan for Varanasi.. Day 01 - Excursion to Sarnath, Evening boat 
                    Ride & Ganges Aarti. Day 02 Varanasi Ghats , BHU, Kashi Vishwanath Temple, Bharat Mata Temple, Tulsi Manas Mandir, Durga Temple, evening shopping Silk Brochade etc</p>
