            <img id="niagara" src="https://www.cliftonhill.com/sites/default/files/whirlpoolchristine6.jpg" width="100%" alt="niagara">
            <p>Niagara falls is that popular because of many reasons. Firstly, the name of city or town is also Niagara falls and there is one more city with same name on america side. Niagara falls is shared attraction
                 between america and canada. It is very beautiful place.. Then there are boats run by both countries which take you nearly under waterfall.
                  There is a bridge near to the waterfall that connects both countries. Then, every friday evening there is beautiful fireworks. Apart from this, the laser lights add various colors to the water flowing
                   down which add to the beauty of waterfalls at night time. Last but not the least there are many more attractions around the falls as well as in the city like Queen Elizabeth park, water parks etc.</p></div>

                <p>Mount Everest is one of the most popular destinations in Tibet. Each year, thousands of tourists come to take this once in a lifetime trip from all around the world. Don't take it granted that Mount
                     Everest is the highest mountain in the world and nothing else special. Mount Everest will surprise you with its extraordinary landscape and brilliant influence in the world.
                    Besides the stunning landscape of Mount Everest itself, there are two great highlights on the Mount Everest - Rongbuk Monastery and Everest Base Camp. Rongbuk Monastery is a Buddhist temple which is
                     believed to be the highest temple in the world. While the Everest Base Camp is the biggest base camp for mountaineers who want to conquer the highest peak in the world.</p>

                <h2>Varanasi...</h2>

                <p> Varanasi is one of the oldest cities in the world, which makes it rich with cultural heritage. The city is home to ghats, temples, museums, and many Puranic places.
                    The best time to visit Varanasi is during the winter months (November to February). Although it gets fairly cold during the winters, this is the best time when you can explore the holy city without 
                    getting tired. The average low temperature is around 5°C.  Varanasi to stay for, I'd say 2 nights and 2 days is enough.  Re: 2N/3D tour plan for Varanasi.. Day 01 - Excursion to Sarnath, Evening boat 
                    Ride & Ganges Aarti. Day 02 Varanasi Ghats , BHU, Kashi Vishwanath Temple, Bharat Mata Temple, Tulsi Manas Mandir, Durga Temple, evening shopping Silk Brochade etc</p>

                    <li>Trains are a nice and easy way to get to where you need to go. Whether you’re commuting to a city or going home from RIT for a school break; trains are roomy, convenient, and give you some time to relax.</li>
                    <li>Remember to bring something to do such as a book to read, music, or a movie if you have a long trip ahead of you. </li>
                    <li>Some trains even have WiFi and other commodities. During my daily commute into Copenhagen for class, one of my favorite things to do was watch the scenery pass outside my window.</li>
                    <li>ust make sure to always have your ticket handy if a ticket inspector comes by.</li>

                <h2>Way to Travel</h2>
                <p>There are some of the most beautiful train journeys in the world that cut through some of the most difficult glaciers, tunnels, imposing alpine, while tasting the drops of surpassing streams, and carrying along the scent
                 of barns, infinite pasture, and rich farms! A ride on these train journeys would leave you pulsating, make you eerie, and take you into a dreamy world where wide angle views are a privilege. A train journey certainly is 
                 a wonderfully joyous occasion. Furthermore, train journeys fill individuals with a feeling of intense excitement. This mode of the journey is best when the travel distance is long. A train journey creates an aura that cannot
                  be experienced with other types of journeys.rain journeys are quite exciting, interesting and comfortable too. Train is in fact one of the most comfortable and economical mode of travel for long distances. I have travelled to 
                  several places by train and made some of the best memories during these journeys. Those have been the most relaxing and thrilling journeys of my life. Watching villages, cultures, houses as you sped across the countryside, has 
                  always pricked my curiosity for better. It’s fascinating that how a train journey could enhance your knowledge about cultures, regions, languages and cuisines. The journey is like reading a book which has all the ingredients to 
                  keep you entertained till the destination. Another, advantage of a journey by train is that it gives an opportunity to interact with people with completely different ethnicity and linguistic backgrounds.When travelling with friends,
                   train journeys are the best. The train trip from Delhi to Jaipur is one of my most memorable train trips. We had all been looking forward to this school trip for a long time. Our trip was full of plans, and we were hoping to have a 
                   great time while on it.  The train started within a few minutes after we arrived at the railway station at 6 in the morning. For a better view of the outside, I occupied the window seat. As we walked, we enjoyed the green fields, mud
                    roads, and huts that we  saw along the way. While looking outside, I chatted with my best friend.</p>
